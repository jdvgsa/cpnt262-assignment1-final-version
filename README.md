Code by: John Dagsa

Bugs that I ran into were content not and values not changing no matter what I did to code.
The solution I found was that I had to clear my cache to see the changes and to see the code functioning as intended.

I also ran into several issues and could not get dark mode to toggle, I used stack overflow as reference with [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72666513/dark-mode-toggle-button-not-functioning], no matter what I did I could not get it to work. So I just opted for making a simplified version by using a button that turns background into black and the text white to mimic "dark mode".

JS is used in Strict Mode.

I used this youtube video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEj0Wu33hJM&ab_channel=SixMinutes.Smarter]
as a reference for creating my input field.
